# Stone Babes


## What is Stone Babes?

### About

You’re a babe, sure. But not just any babe. 

YOU’RE A STONE BABE. And guess what? We know. Stone babes get a little carried away sometimes and lose track of all those sweet, sweet boulders; they sometimes forget to take a quick minute and really appreciate all of those sick sends and newly born projects even.

That’s where we come in. We’re here to keep track of all your crushes and burns so you can get stoned and babe it up out there in the crag. We’ll be you’re official portfolio, your visual diary. Something to remind you that hey, you’re kind of a baddie and maybe the world needs to know? Or maybe just YOU need to know, need to be reminded in case you’ve forgotten since your last climbing trip. 

Don’t let boulders become bygone boulders, stone babe.
